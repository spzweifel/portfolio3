## Description

This portfolio is a rough draft model. I used React to make it and included links to previous projects. It is fully interactive, although, future developments are forthcoming.

Hey Sean! Congratulations on a good homework assignment! You were able to somewhat demonstrate your ability to build a React single-page portfolio! However, the application did lose points because of the following: - Application doesn't have a single Project component that is used multiple times in the Portfolio section - Application's About Me section is missing a photo or avatar of you - Application's Portfolio section has only 5 of 6 required projects and is missing links to the corresponding GitHub repo to accompany the link to the deployed application - Application's Contact section includes a contact form but is missing form field validation. I was able to click submit without filling in no information and got no error messages and I was able to enter just one field and click submit and got no error messages. - Code lacks quality comments. Remember that commenting your code is important so that you understand your code when you return to it later or if someone else reviews your code and wants to understand your thought process - Repository README is missing a screenshot of the application visible when reviewing the repo - Application user experience could be much more intuitive and easy to navigate and the user interface is not clean and polished. It was very confusing to navigate and there was no styling involved Overall, I have to say how nice it was to see you build upon the skills you acquired thus far in the world of full-stack web development! Keep up the hard work! Central Grader - MWA
